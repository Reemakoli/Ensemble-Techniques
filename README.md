Part 1-----------------

DOMAIN: Telecom

• CONTEXT: A telecom company wants to use their historical customer data to predict behaviour to retain customers. You can analyse all
relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

• DATA DESCRIPTION: Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata. The
data set includes information about:
• Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
• Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and
streaming TV and movies
• Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
• Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

 PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To Build a model that will help to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability to churn. This helps the company to understand the pinpoints and patterns of customer churn and will increase the focus on strategizing customer retention.
